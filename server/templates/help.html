<h3>Introduction</h3>
DESCprod is a web service and supporting code to help users to run DESC jobs at NERSC.

The <a href=https://github.com/LSSTDESC/desc-prod/blob/main/README.md>desc-prod README</a>
provides some description of the supporting code.
<br><br>
See the <a href=https://github.com/LSSTDESC/desc-prod/blob/main/doc/apps.md>application document</a>
for a description of how jobs flow though DESCprod and information on adding support for different
types of production jobs.

<h3>Web interface</h3>
To use the DESC web server, point your browser to <a href=https://www.descprod.org>https://www.descprod.org</a>.
<br><br>
To do more than view this document, you will need to tell us who you are.
At present, only google authentication is supported.
Click the login button and you will be taken to their page to sign in if
do not already have credentials in your browser.
If it is the first time you connect, you will have to send some info so we can link your google
and DESC IDs.
Once the link is established, login will take you to the DESCprod home page where you can submit
job and see the status of jobs submitted earlier.
<br><br>
Jobs are specified with three strings:
<ul>
<li>jobtype - The name of the type of job to run.</li>
<li>config - What to do: which input data, which processing steps, configuration prameters, ....</li>
<li>howfig - How to carry out the processing: software source, batch submission or not, job splitting, ....</li>
</ul>
Enter these on the line labeled "Create job:" to create a new job.

<br><br>
The server will accept any job type.
It is the reponsibility of the client that starts the job on a remote machine to install or set up a product
that provides the a direct application for the job type.
Available direct applications include
<ul>
<li>mysleep
<li>parsltest
<li><a href=https://github.com/LSSTDESC/desc-gen3-prod/blob/main/doc/app-g3wfquery.md> g3wfquery</a>
</ul>

The first two are included in the <a href=https://github.com/LSSTDESC/desc-wfmon>desc-wfmon package</a>.
An example config string for parsltest is:
<pre>
    wq-sleep-ttsk10-ntsk20-nwrk4
</pre>
This is a request to use the WorkQueue scheduler to run 20 10-second sleep jobs using four workers.

<h3>Application interface</h3>
A job with type JOBTYPE is ultimately run by calling the script runapp-JOBTYPE.
It is passed the config and howfig strings as arguments and is responsible for intepreting those
and running the job. It returns 0 to indicate success.
The application should also regularly update current-status.txt with a short line giving the
current status of processing.
That text is regularly reported back to the server and can be seen in the job monitor.
<br><br>
The example application mysleep may be found at
<a href=dune-proc/examples/runapp-mysleep](https://github.com/LSSTDESC/desc-prod/blob/main/examples/runapp-mysleep>
desc-prod/examples/runapp-mysleep</a>.
Copy it to your bin area and you should be able to run a job with jobname "mysleep" and config set to the
number of seconds to sleep.

<h3>How interface</h3>
The how configuration string (aka howfig) is a sequence of comma-separated constituents.
The name of the first constituent is its first field, i.e. HNAM in HMAW-HFLD1-HFLD2-....
If HNAM is a name registered with DESCprod,
then runapp-HNAM is run instead of runapp-JOBTYPE with the expectation that the first will either call
the second or create a subjob with that job name.
Other than such registered constituents, the howfig is intepreted by the application script.
<br><br>
Available indirect applications include
<ul>
<li>pmb - Run the direct application (runapp-JOBNAME) in batch. The wrapper continues to run on the client
node until the batch job finishes.
<li>pmbs - Create a DESCprod subjob to run the direct application and submit a batch job that runs a client
that starts that job. The parent job ends after submission and the child reports progress to the server.
</ul>
Both of these are provided as part of desc-prod.
With these option, you can safely run 200+ perlmutter workers in the parsltest example above.
Replace replace sleep with ifix0 in the config to run CPU-intenive jobs or with ifixw to run jobs that are
both CPU and I/O intensive.

<h3>Running jobs</h3>

After a job has been specified on the DESCprod server, it may be started on any client computer with
network access to the server but the primary goal is to support the NERSC machines: perlmutter login
and batch and perhaps workflow machines.
The first step is to install desc-prod on the client:
<pre>
  module install python
  cd some-dir
  git clone https://github.com/LSSTDESC/desc-prod.git
  cd desc-prod
  pip install .
</pre>
The first line ensures a recent version of python at NERSC.
<br><br>
After specifying a a job on the server, you can find its ID in the left-most column of the job table.
Start the job on the client with
<pre>
  descprod-start-job ID
</pre>
Use -h for help on this and other descprod commands.
If all goes well, a subdirectory job...ID will be created in the current directory and the job
will be run there.
Refresh the server page to update the job table and see the job status change.
After completion, there will be a return code (0 if all went well) and an appropriate message in the last column.
<br><br>
To remove clutter on the server page, jobs may be deleted arter completion:
hover over the job ID to obtain links to archive or delete the job.
There is not much point to archive now as we do not yet have the facility to retrieve them from the archive.

<h3>Job output and error handling</h3>
After a job has completed, the return code will appear in the job table and the status message (last column) is updated.
A nonzero code indicates a problem.
DESCprod does not yet provide any mechanism for automatic resubmission or resumption of failed or interrupted jobs.
Such could be added as a howfig applications analogous to pmb.
The job table includes the name of the run node and run directory and users can navigate (typically via perlmutter login)
to that directory and examine the logs and other files.
Log output (stdout and stderr) for the process runnning the wrapper is written to <i>wrapper.log</i> and
log output from the runapp script to <i>jobXXXXXX.log</i> where XXXXXX is the zero-padded job ID.
<br><br>
The job table is updated by refreshing the DESCprod home page.
Before a job is started, the node and run directory will be blank and the create/start time is the time of creation.
Once a job iis started, the host and run directory will be filled and the create/start time replaced
with the process start time.
The job duration is the time of the last wrapper message received since the start/create time.
This will continue to update at the job update interval (currently 10 sec) until the job completes.
If the duration and status message fail to update when a job is in the run state, then
communication has been lost with the wrapper.
This could inddicate the wrapper has hung or crashed, the run node was shut down, or could be due to
network or server problems.

<H3>Coming next</H3>
Our next planned deliverables include:
<ul>
<li>Support for LSST pipeline jobs.</li>
</ul>
Stay tuned.
