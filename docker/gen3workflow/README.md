# images/descprod

This directory contains scripts and configs (dockerfiles) to 
create and run docker images for running DESC pipeline jobs.

The user must first install the docker desktop--see https://docs.docker.com/get-docker.

Below LVER is an LSST version tag (e.g. w\_2023\_15) and XX represents a version tag.
Replace them with your values.

## Creating and using version LVER-XX

First create ./dockerfile-XX most likely by copying one of the
dockerfiles here and making modifications.

Build the image with
<pre>
> ./build LVER XX
</pre>

Test the image by running locally.
<pre>
> ./start LVER XX
lksst:LVER> com1
lksst:LVER> com2
descprod> exit
>
</pre>

Push the image to dockerhub.
<pre>
./push LVER XX
</pre>

Pull the image on another machine.
Replace dladams with the docker username of the installer.
<pre>
> docker pull dladams/gen3workflow-LVER:XX
</pre>
Test as above.

On perlmutter or cori, install with shifter:
<pre>
> shifterimg -v pull dladams/gen3workflow-LVER:XX
</pre>
