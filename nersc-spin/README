David Adams left DESC in March 2024.  There are no current plans to continue developing desc-prod.  The workload had been running on NERSC Spin.
NERSC requested we update the workloads to address potential vulnerability. Rather than address that, we decided to take down the workloads 
and store the final YAMLs for the three workloads here:  desc-prod, desc-prod-jupyter, and dptest.
